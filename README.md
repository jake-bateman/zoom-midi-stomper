# ZOOM MIDI Stomper

This is a Python program intended to run on a Raspberry Pi Zero or equivalent GPIO-equipped SBC, for the purpose of externalising the MIDI patch switching to a homemade pedal. Pins 23 and 24 are used for a momentary stomp switch. `alsa` and it's midi binary `amidi` are dependencies.
